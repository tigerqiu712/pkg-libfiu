Depends:
 ${misc:Depends},
 ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: userspace fault injection framework
 libfiu is a C library for fault injection. It provides functions to mark
 "points of failure" inside your code (the "core API"), and functions to
 enable/disable the failure of those points (the "control API").
 .
 This package contains the libfiu shared library. To perform fault injection,
 you will require the "libfiu-dev" package.
