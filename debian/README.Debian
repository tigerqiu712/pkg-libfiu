README.Debian for libfiu
========================

The libfiuX binary package is provided for the benefit of other packages that
can use it in their testsuites (along with all "local" usage, etc.)

It is not expected that a binary packages will exist in the archive with a
binary dependency on libfiuX; indeed, it is probably a bug if they do.
